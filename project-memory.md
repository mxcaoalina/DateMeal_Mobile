# DateMeal Mobile - Project Memory

## Project Overview
DateMeal Mobile is a React Native application built with Expo that provides restaurant recommendations for dates based on user preferences. It leverages AI to generate personalized restaurant suggestions and provides a conversational interface for users to refine their preferences.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (Stack and Tab navigators)

## Design System
- **Colors**: Updated to a gray palette with primary color `#333333` (dark gray)
- **Typography**: System fonts with defined sizes for headings and body text
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing system based on 4px increments
- **Components**: Shared UI components with consistent styling

## Image Handling Strategy
The application implements a robust image handling approach:

1. **State Management**:
   - Components track loading and error states for images
   - Uses React's useState to manage image loading status

2. **Loading State**:
   - Displays ActivityIndicator (spinner) while images are loading
   - Positioned over the image container for a smooth transition

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements graceful fallbacks when images fail to load
   - Uses the first letter of the restaurant name as a visual placeholder
   - Styled background colors that match the app's theme

4. **Image Sources**:
   - Supports remote URLs from API responses
   - Uses Unsplash random images for mock/demo data
   - Handles null/empty imageUrl values with fallbacks

5. **Consistency**:
   - Same pattern implemented in RecommendationCard and RestaurantDetailScreen
   - Consistent styling for all image states across the application

This approach ensures the UI remains attractive and functional even when image loading fails, which is important for a mobile app where network connectivity can be unpredictable.

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Expo SDK**: Using Expo for easier development and deployment
2. **React Navigation**: For handling navigation between screens
3. **Axios**: For API requests with interceptors for error handling
4. **Zustand**: For state management with persistence
5. **AsyncStorage**: For persisting user data locally
6. **Offline Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of network errors with offline recommendations

## API Endpoints
- `/api/conversations`: Process user messages and return recommendations
- `/api/restaurants/:id`: Get detailed information about a specific restaurant
- `/api/users/preferences`: Save and retrieve user preferences
